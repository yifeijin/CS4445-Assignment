    Problem 4: Solving sink-node problem in PageRank
    In this problem, we implement the pagerank algorithm which can solve the sink node problem.
    You could test the correctness of your code by typing `nosetests test4.py` in the terminal.

def compute_S(A):
    '''
        compute the transition matrix S from addjacency matrix A, which solves sink node problem by filling the all-zero columns in A.
        S[j][i] represents the probability of moving from node i to node j.
        If node i is a sink node, S[j][i] = 1/n.
        Input: 
                A: adjacency matrix, a (n by n) numpy matrix of binary values. If there is a link from node i to node j, A[j][i] =1. Otherwise A[j][i]=0 if there is no link.
        Output: 
                S: transition matrix, a (n by n) numpy matrix of float values.  S[j][i] represents the probability of moving from node i to node j.
    The values in each column of matrix S should sum to 1.
